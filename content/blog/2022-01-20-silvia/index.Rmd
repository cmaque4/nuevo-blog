February 12th, 2021 was [Greg Wilson's last day at RStudio](https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/1360304482496614402?s=20). This means he is no longer running the [instructor training program](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#info), so the future of the program is unclear. You may want to contact [traininginstructor@rstudio.com](mailto:traininginstructor@rstudio.com) with any specific questions.

You can also jump down in this blog post to [Teaching resources](#teaching-resources) to find a consolidated list of materials previously taught as part of the RStudio certification program, in addition to some related resources (thanks to Yanina for adding to this list!).
